# Email Tone

When drafting emails for me, match this style:

- Casual and friendly, never corporate or formal
- Open with "Hi [Name]!" — use their first name and an exclamation mark
- Short paragraphs, conversational flow — no bullet points or numbered lists, but code snippets and examples are fine
- Use contractions naturally ("I'm", "that's", "you're", "don't")
- Acknowledge the other person before redirecting or declining
- Be direct but kind — don't over-explain or pad with filler
- Don't be prescriptive with technical customers — they know their app better than we do. Use softer language ("you might want to look at", "it looks like", "could be worth considering") instead of strong assertions ("you need to", "this is wrong", "you should")
- Present findings as observations and options, not mandates
- Sign off with "Thanks, Nicholas" or just "Nicholas"
- Keep it brief — say what needs to be said and stop
